# 🤝 Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System 🌟

Welcome to the **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System**! 🚀 This project leverages **collaborative filtering** techniques to recommend items (e.g., movies, books, or products) based on user-item interactions. By analyzing patterns in user preferences, this system delivers personalized recommendations to enhance user experiences. 🎯

---

## 🌟 Overview

Collaborative filtering is a cornerstone of modern recommendation systems, powering platforms like Netflix and Amazon. This project focuses on building a recommendation engine that predicts user preferences by identifying similar users or items based on ratings or interactions. It builds on the author's previous work, such as the [Hybrid Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Hybrid_Movie_Recommendation_System), but emphasizes collaborative filtering techniques. 📊

## 🎯 Features

| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**       | Clean and prepare user-item interaction data (e.g., ratings, likes).            |
| 📊 **Collaborative Filtering**  | Implement user-based or item-based collaborative filtering using techniques like matrix factorization or KNN. |
| 🤖 **Prediction Models**        | Predict user ratings or preferences for unseen items.                          |
| 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**       | Measure performance with metrics like RMSE, MAE, or precision/recall.           |
| 🌐 **Web Interface**           | (Optional) Build a Streamlit app for interactive recommendations.              |
| 💾 **Model Export**            | Save trained models as `.pkl` files for deployment.                            |

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset will likely include:
- **User-Item Interactions**: Ratings, likes, or views (e.g., user-movie ratings).
- **Item Metadata**: (Optional) Details like genres, titles, or categories.
- **User Profiles**: (If available) Demographic or behavioral data.

*(Dataset details and source will be added once available.)*
